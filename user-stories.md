**Sabrina**

Sabrina hails from Minnesota.  She loves animals and has a couple of dogs.  When it comes to products, she has what she needs and doesn't really need anything new to help her get through a normal day.  She is looking for interesting things to add some spice to her life while not fishing for anything particularly useful.  She'd like to know the outcome of her choices to gain a better understanding of her deepest subconscious desires.

**George**

George comes from New York.  He likes just about everything and lives to try new things.  His chaotic choices in life are reflected in the cleanliness of his abode, a messy maze that is almost impassable without plowing straight through.
